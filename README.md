# Section A Q2

it contains the Data Structure and Algorithm question and the solution

A Folder was Created named SectionA, which contain a File with question.js and a docs of the solution of the Two Sum Question and make use of Brute Force for the dsa and JavaScript

## Question 2

2. ## Two Sum
   ## Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such

## that they add up to target.

## You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the

## same element twice.

## You can return the answer in any order.

## Fuzz data:

    [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5], target = -8
    [0, 4, 3, 0], target = 0
    Constraints:
    2 <= nums.length <= 104
    -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
    -109 <= target <= 109

## Only one valid answer exists.

## Answer to question 2

1.  input nums = [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5], target = -8
    output = [2, 4]
    Because nums[2] + nums[4] == -8, we return [2, 4]

2.  input nums = [0, 4, 3, 0], target = 0
    output = [0, 3]
    Because nums[0] + nums[3] == 0, we return [0, 3]

## Section B Q3

Make use of ReactJs using pnpm to install vite + React

## Questions:

# How would you manage the application state in your SPA?

Making use of useState to handle individual state component and UseReducer for the reducer of the function of the state.

# Describe how you would implement routing in the SPA.

To implement routing, i will use react-router-dom

# How would you handle form validation and error messages?

Form Validation can be handle byu using the controlled for the form input and for the error messages i can use state to tract validation error and to display it in the UI design.
